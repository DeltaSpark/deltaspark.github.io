# Why Hello There!
Welcome! You've found the guts to [my website](https://andychu.me). This website and repo exists because I want to:

- showcase my work
- write and design my personal website from scratch
- force myself to use Git
- have a space to test out UI elements and features in the future

## Who Is This For?
This repo is mostly for me, but if you like what you see, you can also use this code to:

- create a personal site for yourself

## Installation
If you want to run this site locally:

- `git clone` the URL to your machine
- open it on your browser
- party!

If you want to have a usable site on GitHub:

- `git clone` it into [your own GitHub repo](https://pages.github.com/)
- `git rm CNAME LICENSE` to remove my CNAME and License files
- edit the HTML including *index.html* and the *cmp/* directory to reflect your own details
- `git rm img/*` to remove my assets and replace them with your own
- replace *favicon.ico* with your own
- party, but now with kittens!
